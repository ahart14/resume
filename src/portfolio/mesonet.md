The Hennepin County Emergency Management department uses its Mesonet application to provide real-time data to emergency managers and incident commanders in east-central Minnesota. This environmental information is used to support their critical response decisions. They were paying a vendor over $400,000 a year for hosting and support and needed to bring this system in-house. We moved this site to systems supported by the county, redesigned it with a modern interface and better performance, and improved the data handling methods.
