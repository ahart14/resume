The Digital Service team had common requests for websites to market various programs or initiatives for Hennepin County. As a result, we built a marketing template to significantly reduce the design and development time needed to complete these requests. In addition, the template included a library of components to meet the various content requirements.

<p class="toggle-role">My role included:</p>

- Determining the necessary components to meet the highest priority requirements.
- Collaborating with brand designers to ensure the components met brand standards.
- Designing content models within the content management system.
- Front-end development.
- Back-end development and build of the components in the content management system.

Examples of the template in use include:\
[hennepin.us/transit](https://www.hennepin.us/transit)\
[hennepin.us/adoption](https://www.hennepin.us/adoption)\
[hennepin.us/ashtrees](https://www.hennepin.us/ashtrees)
