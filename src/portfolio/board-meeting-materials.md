The Hennepin County Board requested help improving the public search function for items related to County Board meetings. They had recently purchased new administrative software, and the public-facing search did not meet their expectations. In addition, the updated software created multiple data sources for new data vs. legacy data, requiring users to search various tools to find the necessary information. 

Along with help from Enterprise Architecture, we were able to design them a solution that unified the data sources and hosted the search application inexpensively in the cloud while still meeting the data retention requirements and storage needs.

<p class="toggle-role">My role included:</p>

- Working with Enterprise Architecture to select the appropriate technology for the designed solution.
- Consulting throughout the project on the implementation design and chosen technologies.
- Researching to determine data sources and functional requirements.
- Negotiating the need for user research and design time with the client.
- Front-end development.
