The ACLU came to Advomatic for a complete site upgrade and redesign to their national site. They also requested a focus on meeting strict accessibility and usability guidelines for both the public and site administrators and content managers. As part of the redesign, we delivered a library of pre-built components to allow content managers to adjust the pages' content and layout.
