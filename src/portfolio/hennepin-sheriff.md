The Hennepin County Sheriff's office had an outdated and unsupported site and needed a complete redesign and build. The Digital Service team conducted a full content audit and information architecture process, held stakeholder interviews, delivered wireframes and prototypes, and ran usability testing sessions. We redesigned the site with branding consistent with Hennepin County but unique enough to provide the department with its own presence. We rebuilt the site in the supported content management system to allow content authors to update the site.
