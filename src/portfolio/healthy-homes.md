Hennepin County's Environmental Health department requested help increasing the number of qualified households receiving grants for lead abatement and saving staff time in determining eligibility.

We conducted a user research phase on the existing process, then designed and built a streamlined process that residents or vendors could use to determine eligibility and assist residents on steps to proceed. Data captured during this process would be available for integration into a CRM in future iterations.
