The Digital Service team was brought in to improve Hennepin County's single sign-on tool and its user experience using Microsoft B2C. The existing enterprise sign-on solution did not meet user experience standards, did not offer basic features, was quite buggy, and too expensive to support.

<p class="toggle-role">My role included:</p>

- supervising user research staff
- design
- usability testing
- delivering user flows and wireframes
- all front-end code and tool customization to match the designed flows and wireframes

I also built a proof-of-concept service portal to demonstrate how this tool could be used across the enterprise.

The first application to adopt the new single sign-on tool in production was the [Citizen Advisory Board application](https://citizenadvisoryapplication.hennepin.us/).
