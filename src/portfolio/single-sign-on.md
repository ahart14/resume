The Digital Service team determined it was necessary to improve Hennepin County's single sign-on tool and its user experience using Microsoft B2B and B2C. The existing enterprise sign-on solution did not meet user experience standards, did not offer basic features, was quite buggy, and was too expensive to support.

- Working with enterprise architects to understand business cases for selecting the correct tool and understanding technical requirements.
- Delivering user flows and wireframes.
- Leading usability testing sessions.
- Consulting on the feasibility of visual design iterations.
- Developing the front-end code and tool customization to match the designed flows and wireframes.
- Building a proof-of-concept service portal to demonstrate how to use single-sign-on across the enterprise.
